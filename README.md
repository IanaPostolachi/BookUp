This is an app that provides the functionality of searching for differnt books and sorting them 
in differnt lists by different categoties(e.g. "Favorite","Read" etc). 
There might be a the possibilty of leaving some reviwes for the books that you've read. 
But the main idea is to look through diffrent books written by differnet authors and see their description.
